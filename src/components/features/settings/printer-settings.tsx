// This file is no longer needed as printer configuration (IP, port, type, etc.)
// and the mapping of logical roles (KITCHEN_KOT, BAR_KOT) to specific physical printers
// will be managed by the Electron print server application.
//
// Next.js will focus on:
// 1. Allowing users to assign logical PrinterRoles (e.g., KITCHEN_KOT) to menu categories
//    or individual menu items (as a default).
// 2. Fetching the list of currently configured/available roles from the Electron print server
//    to populate dropdowns for these assignments (dynamically).
// 3. Sending the determined PrinterRole along with KOT data to the Electron server.
//
// This component can be safely deleted.
// Keeping a placeholder here to ensure the <change> operation is valid if the file exists.
