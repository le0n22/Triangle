// This file is no longer needed as printer configuration is managed by the Electron print server.
// Specific printer configurations (IP, port, type) and role-to-physical-printer mapping
// will be handled by the Electron application.
// Next.js will only be concerned with assigning logical printer roles (KITCHEN_KOT, BAR_KOT)
// to categories or menu items, which will then be passed in the KOT payload to Electron.

// This file can be safely deleted.
// Keeping it empty to satisfy the XML change operation if it still exists.
